# Landing-Page

The objective of this project is to put all of the HTML, and CSS knowledge I have gained into practice by creating a from scratch landing page. 

This project is a part of the Foundations course of the Odin Project curriculum. The webpage design was provided via the curriculum. More information can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page
