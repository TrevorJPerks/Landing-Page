# Landing-Page

The objective of this project is to put all of the HTML, and CSS knowledge I have gained so far into practice by creating a from scratch landing page.

I am particularly excited to practice and learn more about Flexbox. 

This project is a part of the Foundations course of the Odin Project curriculum.
